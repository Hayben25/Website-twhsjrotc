            <p class="join-text">We invite you to consider enrolling in Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC). Young men and women ready forthe challenge of living by an Honor Code and core values, and learning leadership through experience and service, will becomebetter citizens and adults. We typically have 150-200 cadets from grades 9-12 in the program each school year.</p>
            <p class="join-text"><b>We are not military recruiters; there is NO military obligation for cadets after high school.</b>Students considering military service naturally benefit from JROTC, and we can help prepare them for enlistment, college ROTC, or Service Academies; but ourfocus is <b>citizenship, leadership, service, teamwork, and character development.</b>  Cadets learn hands-on followership and leadership.  We do <b>not</b> teach or tolerate yelling, physical discipline/punishment, or physical or verbal abuse.  We model positive leadership by example.</p>
            <p class="join-text">Cadets enjoy shared values, a variety of activities, and a sense of family in JROTC.  It is a program where <b>good kids find the support to be great kids.</b>  We emphasize academic performance, professional appearance, personal responsibility, health andfitness, and moral conduct.  Our JROTC curriculum is built on aerospace science, cultural studies, survival skills, college and adultlife skills, leadership development, and physical fitness.</p>
            <p class="join-text"><b>JROTC is an academic class period during the normal school day</b> which can count as either a PE credit (if needed, due to ourfitness curriculum) or an elective credit. Students can participate in JROTC and still be in band, athletics, and other school activities.There is a modest $200 annual program fee.  <b>Cadets must get a school physical before participating.</b>   They must also adhere toAir Force grooming standards and wear the Air Force uniform (issued free of charge) weekly.  JROTC is <b>not just for young men</b>—a third of our cadets are female.</p>
            <p class="join-text">Many of our exciting activities occur after school, and are <b>voluntary</b> for cadets.  We have award-winning <b>teams</b> for Military Drill, Academics, Marksmanship, Orienteering, Physical Fitness, Cyber, and Aerospace/Drone competitions.  We have a JROTC-specific<b>honor society</b>, and cadets can <b>letter in JROTC.</b>  We offer monthly <b>events</b> such as games, field trips, college visits, a chili cook-off, and formal events.  Corps-sponsored <b>community service</b> is also an important part of our program. We collectively contribute over2,500 hours of community service in the local area annually. </p>
            <p class="join-text">For more information, please visit the JROTC instructors at the Senior Campus and/or contact your counselor.  The Woodlands High School’s JROTC program is first-rate—thank you for considering us!</p>
